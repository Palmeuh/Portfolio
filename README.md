# Portolio Site

This site is created as part of my CMS course. The front page
will be editable by the user and there'll also be a seperate 
page for creating different projects to be included in the projects.
This feature will be added later on.

## Description

At this point it's only the front page that's editable by the user by
going to Pages -> Home Page -> Edit.
